                Not much to see here folks. If you came expecting a deep dive into how my character traits
                I recommend keeping your expections in check. <br> At my core I am a comedic individual, using any
                chance at my diposal to formulate a quip/joke relating to the current matter at hand. <br>
                Emotions? Haven't used alot of those in a while. Anger, satisfaction and confusion are m default 
                states of mind if i were to choose. <br> Now hobbies are what brings me satifaction. I read, dabble in
                the games of video and watch anything worth of entertainment on the net. <br> Overall I'm and honest 
                individual who will tell you how it is without apology because i believe that's how people improve
                and build on their current situation the fastest.

                    As most personality tests it describes some of th characteristics associated with my given 
                    personality <br> correctly but in the same instance is only so accurate in terms of me as a person in whole. <br>
                    In my opinion if you want a rough estimate based on certain critera of questions of your personality then 
                    attempting <br> one test such as this wouldn't hurt but i advise not to use it as and end all determiner of you 
                    as a person. I guess.
