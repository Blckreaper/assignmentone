                        <ol>
                            <li> Over years of constant exposure to programming I have developed a keen sense for systematic problem solving.
                               It has been the norm for me to approach every problem with steps involved with solving them.</li><br>
                            <li>Consistency is also one of my strengths whather it is my academic endevours, my current job or something simple
                               such as exercising daily. I am able to maintain a above mediocre state of performance over a long period of time 
                               compared to the average joe</li><br> 
                            <li>Dependability is also something I pride mysef in. It is if it's engrained in me to not be the weak link that hold 
                               others back and even if it was the case I would go above and beyond to remedy that porblem. I would also be the 
                               first one to help a member lagging behind because being dependable at this point is just who I am.</li><br>

            <li>Chapter 4 - Charlie speaks to Micheal about how setting a goal is important because of what it requires of you to achieve it.
                He further expounded stating that Setting goals entails choosing a destination and creating a strategy to get there. 
                You may create the future you want by setting goals that challenge you and force you to think and act differently. 
                Don't wait for others to assign you goals.</li><br>
            <li>Chapter 5 -Charlie continued to impart knowledge on Micheal regarding that there is only one excellent opportunity out of 
                thousands that exist every day. Either the sorrow of regret or the pain of discipline must be endured by each and every one 
                of us. Discipline weighs a few ounces, while regret weighs several tons. The opportunities that best fit your long-term 
                objectives are the ones you should focus on each day. Don&apost just go through the day, get from the day. Don&apost spend 
                you time on urgent, spend your time on what is important. The design of our lives must be done by us.</li><br>
            <li>Chapter 6 - Three weeks after their intial meeting Charlie and Micheal met at a pool behind a house. 
                They had a sit down and Charlie contiues to advise Micheal on the twelve pillars starting with avoid 
                easy company; you won't advance. Go where there are high standards and performance requirements.
                Consider the following: Who am I surrounded by? Why are they having such an impact on me? What are they 
                making me read? What are they making me say? Where are they taking me? What are they making me think? 
                The most crucial question is: What do they envision me as? Then, ponder whether or not that is acceptable.
                Convenience friends. This idea has some appeal. Is it simpler to maintain existing friendships than to make new ones? 
                Successful people seek connections with like-minded individuals who will push, challenge, and inspire them to improve.
                You must be appealing in order to draw attractive people. not actually, but mentally and in terms of who you are. 
                People you associate with have a big impact on your mindset.</li><br>
            <li>The final last lesson Charlie gave to Micheal in this particular scene was your livelihood will come from formal schooling.
                Your own education will bring you great wealth. You educate yourself by doing it yourself. It is what you discover along 
                the journey that will keep you evolving and expanding. Being focused on continual learning can help you stand out from the 
                crowd because most individuals don't do it. Wealth begins with education. Health begins with education. Spirituality begins 
                with learning. The magical process all starts with searching and learning. The majority of life is experienced after formal 
                education. Therefore, the remaining steps are up to you. The books must be read by you. The best learning resources available
                to people today have been and will be books.</li><br>

                            Upon the completion of these chapters I can say with confidence all of the information within these texts can be 
                            applied to everyone's life and yield satifactory results at the least and monumental changes in the right direction
                            at best. Chapter 4 speaks on setting goals where it's crucial to have a set destination you plan on arriving via plans 
                            you've constructed to achieve said goal. By implenting this within my own life this provides me with a clear and concise
                            path to traverse to complete any future goals whether short or long term. When it comes to chapter 5 it speaks of oppurtunies 
                            ad how to allocate your time and resources as it pertains to short and long term goals. This also leads back to how it speaks 
                            of the sorrow of regret and pain of displine where I as a student for example I should focus more on the larger projects due at
                            a later date than homework that s due next week, it's better an spend more time on the one that carries most of my grade or 
                            displine myself enough to save the limited allownace I recive than regret spending on frivilous pleasantries. Chapter 6 focuses on 
                            how your surroundings affects your mindset and ability to achieve or improve something greaerr han you are currently. The company 
                            you keep is a reflection of you because you are what you attract and it's best you surround yourself with successsful, goal oriented
                            people such as yourself. As it relates to me all it means is that I try and surround myslef with high achievers so I too can maintain 
                            such mindset. Lastley chapter 7 speaks on education where that formal means of schooling provides a sustainable lifestyle but your own 
                            eductaion bring you wealth. As this would apply to me as a student is that learning waht I am taught in class is not enogh and that I 
                            must do my own research and learn my own skillsets to maximize my options in the generation of income in the future. This book on a whole 
                            is a great learning tool in how to optimize your current lifestyle to increase your quality of life for the present and the impending future.
