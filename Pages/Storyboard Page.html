                        <h2 align = "center">Website Theme</h2>
                        <p>The main colours used within the creation of the website sre that of yellow and blue. <br>
                            Yellow was used for the front an dstoryboard page because it represents feelings of 
                            happiness, <br> positivity and optimism which is the feelings I wish to invoke on first 
                            exposure to the website. <br> Blue was used for the remainder of the pages ehich focused 
                            and me as a person beacuse it represents stability, <br> harmony, peace, calm and trust
                            which is what i myslef beieve I represent and would like to give that impression to 
                            the user.
                        </p>

                        <h2 align = "center">Target Audience</h2>
                        <p>I'm mostly focused on my demographic of yung adoloscence which can be seen with the 
                            use of language <br> when speaking of myself to be more relatable to my peers as if I am 
                            speaking to them casually.
                        </p>

                        <p>Don't expect too much. This webite is more information focused than asthetic or a multitude
                            of features. <br> Pictures, email capabilities and bokkmarks  and the most stand out fetures this 
                            website offers.
